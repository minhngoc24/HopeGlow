# HopeGlow

## Problem Statement

Many individuals and community organizations — such as low-income families, patients, orphans, or small charities — are in need of everyday support and donated items. At the same time, countless people are willing to give, but lack a convenient and trusted way to connect with those in need.

More importantly, a person may be a **donor** one day and a **recipient** the next — generosity is not one-directional.

## Our Solution

**HopeGlow** is a web-based donation platform that allows users to **donate and receive items based on proximity and need**. Whether you're offering support or seeking it, HopeGlow provides a fast, simple, and secure space to connect, share, and uplift your local community.
